There are four simple python applications:
1) supermemo.py, which enables you to use a gamepad while learning languages on supermemo.com. This application uses Selenium and PyGame modules.
2) cwicz.py, which was created to track and backup running results and display them on a graph. This application uses the matplotlib, time, and json modules.
3) int2roman, a simple program that converts integers into Roman numerals using a recursive function.
4) station.py - downloads a list of radio stations from the net and allows you to select one from a list, turns it on and shows the name of the artist and song.
