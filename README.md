Here you will find 4 small programs designed/aimed at confirming the ability to freely program small applications and scripts in Python. Here they are:

1) stacje.py - downloads a list of radio stations from the net and allows you to select one from the list, starts it and shows the name of the artist and song. This is a really nice app you can start off just from your linux console
2) supermemo.py, which enables you to use a gamepad while learning languages on supermemo.com. This application uses Selenium and PyGame modules (keep in mind that you have to have a relevant geckodriver already installed - as well as said modules)
3) cwicz.py, which was created to track and backup my running results and display them on a nice graph. This application uses the matplotlib, time, and json modules.
4) int2roman, a very simple program that converts integers into Roman numerals using a recursive function.
5) init-containers-usage - a compressed helm package that illustrates how to use init-containers in Kubernetes cluster.
